# UC1 - Register Organization

## 1- Requirements engineering

The administrator initializes an organization. The system requests information about the organization (e.g. name, email, nif), the manager(e.g. name, email) and the collaborator(e.g. name, email, phone number). The administrator inserts the information. The system validates the information and shows it to the administrator to confirm. The system registers the information about the organization, the manager and collaborator and gives an automatic password to the manager and collaborator by email and informs the administrator about the success of the operation.
