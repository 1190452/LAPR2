### Full format

#### Main actor

Administrator

#### Stakeholders and their interests

Exist freelancers to send emails.

#### Postconditions

The emails with the performance of the freelancers are sent to the respective

#### Main success scenario (or basic flow)

1. The administrator begins sending the email to mean performance freelancers.
2. The system identifies the freelancers who have a task delay greater than 3 hours and their percentage of task delay higher than the percentage of overall delays. Then sends emails to them and informs about the operation.
Â 
#### Extensions (or alternative flows)

2c. The system does not contain freelancers with a task delay greater than 3 hours or greater than the percentage of overall delays.
> 1. The system warns the administrator about that. The use case ends

### Systematization ##

It follows from the rational that the conceptual classes promoted to software classes are:

 * Platform
 * Freelancer
 * Task
 * Task Execution
 * Writer

Other software classes (i.e. Pure Fabrication) identified:  

 * WarnAboutFreelancerPerformanceUI
 * WarnAboutFreelancerPerformanceController
 * RegisterFreelancer
